# AI SDK for Manufacturing - Learning Guide

Welcome to the comprehensive guide for building AI-powered manufacturing applications using the Vercel AI SDK. This course focuses on practical, real-world applications in steel manufacturing.

## Course Overview

This course teaches you how to build three types of AI applications for manufacturing:

1. **Invisible AI** - Automate data extraction and forecasting without user interaction
2. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** - Build knowledge bases with semantic search
3. **Conversational AI** - Create interactive chatbots with tool calling

Each lesson builds on the previous one, teaching you progressively more advanced AI SDK features.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- [ ] **JavaScript/TypeScript knowledge** - Comfortable with modern JavaScript and TypeScript
- [ ] **React familiarity** - Understand React hooks and components
- [ ] **Node.js v20 or later** - LTS version recommended
- [ ] **pnpm package manager** - Install with `npm install -g pnpm`
- [ ] **Vercel account** - Free account at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
- [ ] **Git** - For cloning and version control

## Learning Path

Follow these guides in order for the best learning experience:

### Getting Started (30 minutes)

- **[00-getting-started.md](./00-getting-started.md)** - Project setup, environment configuration, and course overview

### Lesson 1: Invisible AI (2-3 hours)

Learn how to build AI systems that work behind the scenes to automate manufacturing workflows.

- **[Part 1: Introduction](./01-invisible-ai-part1-introduction.md)** - Understanding invisible AI and manufacturing use cases
- **[Part 2: Data Extraction](./01-invisible-ai-part2-extraction.md)** - Extracting structured data from unstructured formats
- **[Part 3: Material Calculation](./01-invisible-ai-part3-calculation.md)** - Calculating material requirements using AI
- **[Part 4: Forecasting](./01-invisible-ai-part4-forecasting.md)** - Time-phased material forecasting and scrap prediction

### Lesson 2: RAG (3-4 hours)

Learn how to build a knowledge base system with semantic search using embeddings and cosine similarity.

- **[Part 1: Introduction](./02-rag-part1-introduction.md)** - What is RAG and why it matters for manufacturing
- **[Part 2: Chunking](./02-rag-part2-chunking.md)** - Breaking down documents into searchable chunks
- **[Part 3: Embeddings](./02-rag-part3-embeddings.md)** - Generating vector embeddings for semantic search
- **[Part 4: Cosine Similarity](./02-rag-part4-similarity.md)** - Finding relevant content using similarity matching
- **[Part 5: Building RAG Agent](./02-rag-part5-building-rag-agent.md)** - Creating a complete RAG system with tools

### Lesson 3: Conversational AI (2-3 hours)

Learn how to build interactive chatbots that can query real-time data from manufacturing systems.

- **[Part 1: Introduction](./03-conversational-ai-part1-introduction.md)** - Understanding conversational AI in manufacturing
- **[Part 2: Basic Chat Interface](./03-conversational-ai-part2-basic-chat.md)** - Creating a chat UI with streaming responses
- **[Part 3: Tool Calling](./03-conversational-ai-part3-tool-calling.md)** - Enabling AI to execute functions for real-time data
- **[Part 4: Multi-Step Execution](./03-conversational-ai-part4-multi-step.md)** - Advanced tool chaining for complex queries

## How to Use These Guides

### Self-Learning Tips

1. **Follow sequentially** - Each part builds on previous concepts
2. **Take breaks** - Each part is designed for 30-45 minutes of focused learning
3. **Complete checkpoints** - Don't skip the "Check Your Understanding" sections
4. **Try the exercises** - Hands-on practice reinforces learning
5. **Review code examples** - Type them out rather than copy-pasting when possible

### Navigation

- Each guide part includes navigation links at the bottom
- Use "Next" and "Previous" links to move between parts
- Return to this README anytime to see the full learning path

### Estimated Time

- **Getting Started**: 30 minutes
- **Lesson 1**: 2-3 hours (4 parts × 30-45 min each)
- **Lesson 2**: 3-4 hours (5 parts × 30-45 min each)
- **Lesson 3**: 2-3 hours (4 parts × 30-45 min each)
- **Total**: 8-10 hours

### Getting Help

If you get stuck:

1. **Review the code examples** - They're complete and runnable
2. **Check the troubleshooting sections** - Common issues are documented
3. **Verify your setup** - Make sure environment variables are configured
4. **Test incrementally** - Run code after each step, not just at the end
